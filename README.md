This repository guides the user on how to create a multitool USB drive that can boot ISO images and store files simultaneously. By following the instructions provided in this repository, you will be able to create a bootable USB drive that can run multiple operating systems, software and utilities, for example:

<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, ArchLinux for Linux distribution</li>
  <li>Windows 10, 8.1, 7 for Windows operating systems</li>
  <li>Hiren's BootCD, Ultimate Boot CD, Windows PE for troubleshooting and repair tools</li>
</ul>

Users will also be able to store and access files from the same drive, making it a convenient tool for carrying important documents, pictures, videos and other files with them on the go. This guide is a must-have for anyone looking to make the most out of their USB drive.

<h2>Where to start?</h2>
The first thing you need is a USB storage, it's important to consider the speed and capacity of the drive. USB 3.0 is the minimum standard to look for as it provides faster data transfer speeds compared to previous versions. It's recommended to use a USB 3.0 drive with a high read and write speeds for better performance when booting and running operating systems or software from the drive. Furthermore, for larger ISO images or for storing more files, a high capacity drive is recommended. You can look for a USB drive with at least 32 GB of storage capacity or higher to ensure that you have enough space for multiple ISO images and files. Some popular options for fast USB 3.0 drives include SanDisk Ultra, Kingston DataTraveler or Samsung Fit Plus among many others.

<h2>Making the USB a tool</h2>
To download and install the Ventoy tool to a flash drive, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of Ventoy from the official website (https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html)<br>
2. Insert your USB flash drive into your computer and make sure it is detected by the system.<br>
3. Open the downloaded Ventoy package and run the installer.<br>
4. During the installation process, you will be prompted to select the target USB drive. Make sure to select the correct drive, as this process will erase all data on the selected drive.<br>
5. Once the installation is complete, you can use the flash drive to boot various ISO images.<br>
6. You can copy the ISO files to the flash drive and Ventoy will automatically detect them and allows you to boot them.<br>
7. You can also add new ISO files to the USB drive after it has been initialized with Ventoy and boot them by simply selecting them from the boot menu.<br>

It is important to note that before installing Ventoy, make sure to backup any important files from the USB drive, as the installation process will erase all data on the drive.

<h2>Recommended ISO Images and Tools</h2>
When it comes to creating a multitool USB drive, having a variety of Linux distributions and tools can be extremely useful. Some popular and useful Linux distributions to have on your USB drive include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and ArchLinux. These distributions offer a wide range of features and tools, and can be used for various purposes such as troubleshooting, recovery, and general use.<br>

In addition to Linux distributions, having a variety of troubleshooting and recovery tools can also be extremely useful. Some popular tools include GParted for partition management, Testdisk for data recovery, and ClamAV for virus scanning.<br>

Another useful tool is the Network Utility toolkit like Nmap, Wireshark, and tcpdump. These tools can be used for network troubleshooting and analysis, which can come in handy when trying to diagnose and fix network issues.<br>

Lastly, having a bootable antivirus tool can be important for security reasons, like Avira rescue system or Kaspersky rescue disk.
Having these tools on your USB drive can be a life saver in case of any emergency situation.<br>

In short, having a variety of Linux distributions and tools on your USB drive can be extremely useful for troubleshooting, recovery, and general use. It's a good idea to have a selection of Linux distros, troubleshooting and recovery tools, and antivirus on your multitool USB drive to be prepared for any situation.<br>
